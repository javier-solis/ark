# Ark

A compact CLI app for Academic Record Keeping.

App is an ongoing WIP.

# Dependencies
## General
(Ideally none, once standalone binary became available/)

## Development
Rust, Crate's dependencies.

# Development
A note on comments:
* `todo:` = needs to be addressed at some point
* `q:` = a section to be triaged (before becoming a `todo` of some sort)
* Eventually I'll add add a level of importance to each. Something like `todo(x):`, where x is a tag (e.g. refactor).

## Future Features
* User input for what they want to request (e.g. weighted v.s. unweighted gpa, # of classes, # of As, Bs, etc.)
* Package app into a standalone binary.
* Addressing the numerous `todo` comments throughout the project.
